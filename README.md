# BidCalculatorApp
To use the BidCalculatorApp, open it in Visual Studio. You will find two projects: 
1. BidCalculatorApi and
2. VehicleBiddingApp.
The first project is an API with a defined endpoint, while the second one is a Vue app. The app captures the API response inside the vue app.

The solution is designed to allow you to run both the API and web app together by simply playing the solution. Alternatively, you can run the API project and then run the wwwroot/index.html file separately.

The API runs on port 5238, while the web app runs on port 5296.
