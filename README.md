# BidCalculatorApp
Open in visual studio. You will get two projects
1. BidCalculatorApi
2. VehicleBiddingApp

The first project is the API with defined end point and the second one is vue app. The API is getting called by the app and produces the result. 
The solution is configured in a way that you can simply play the solution and this will the fire the api and the web app at the same time. Or you can run the api project and then run the wwwroot/index.html file separately.
